  # UNDER MEASUREMENT (2026-07-29) - this contradicts the contract at the top of
  # this file. It turns output the adapter could not parse into a schema-valid
  # SUCCESS envelope, and all four callers then exit 0. The run goes green and the
  # wrapped blob is published as the skill's deliverable (aeon.yml "Capture skill
  # output" -> output/.chains/<skill>.md), which chained skills consume and the
  # health scorer grades. Its 0/0/0/0 usage is also indistinguishable from a real
  # cheap run in memory/token-usage.csv.
  #
  # validate_envelope structurally cannot catch this: the object emitted below is
  # exactly the shape that function checks (.result string + four numeric counts).
  #
  # The correct behaviour is `exit 3` (abnormal stop), and the workflow's failure
  # path for it already exists and works - aeon.yml emits ::error::, writes
  # /tmp/skill-error.txt and exits 1, and the `outcome == 'success'` gate then
  # withholds the output. Flipping it is deferred only because nothing measured
  # how often this fires, so the blast radius across a live fleet was unknown.
  #
  # So: identical behaviour, now COUNTABLE. The marker below reaches the workflow
  # through the harness stderr tail, which promotes it to a ::warning::. Once
  # there is a real number, replace this body with a diagnostic + `exit 3` and
  # drop the `exit 0` at each call site.
