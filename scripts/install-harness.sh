# install-harness — stage a harness CLI and its provider auth on the runner.
#
# Extracted from aeon.yml's "Install harness CLI" step so every workflow that
# launches an agent can stage any of the six. It was inline in aeon.yml, which is
# the only reason messages.yml supported just claude/grok: a repo configured for
# codex/pi/vibe/kimi had its inbound messages answered on claude, because nothing
# on that workflow could install the CLI. Same class of bug as the two-path grok
# trap (#784) — a capability that exists on one surface and silently doesn't on
# another. The logic lives here now; each workflow supplies its own `env:` block,
# since `secrets.*` only resolves inside a workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/install-harness.sh [harness]      # or set $H
#
# claude is a no-op: workflows install it themselves (pinned + npm-cached) and it
# needs no per-provider auth. Calling this with `claude` is therefore fine and
# does nothing, so a caller can invoke it unconditionally.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   H            harness name (or $1)
#   HM           harness model — the OpenRouter id baked into the staged config
#   AUTH_MODE    native-oauth | native-key | openrouter   (from resolve-harness.sh)
#   plus the provider credentials for that harness (see the cases below)
#
# Everything written lands in the runner's ephemeral $HOME and is never echoed.
