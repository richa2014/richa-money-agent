# resolve-harness — decide WHICH harness runs, on WHICH provider, with WHICH model.
#
# Extracted from aeon.yml's "Resolve harness" step so every surface that launches
# an agent resolves identically. It is the companion of scripts/install-harness.sh
# (which stages the CLI these outputs describe) and of harness-adapter/run-harness
# (which consumes MODEL_ARG). Splitting the decision from the workflow is what lets
# messages.yml support all nine harnesses instead of only claude/grok — a gap that
# existed purely because this ~100 lines lived inside one workflow step.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/resolve-harness.sh [skill-name]     -> KEY=VALUE lines on stdout
#
# The skill name is OPTIONAL: it selects the per-skill `harness:`/`model:`
# overrides from aeon.yml. Omit it for surfaces that aren't a per-skill run
# (inbound messages), and the repo-global keys decide — which is what those
# surfaces want, and the reason the same script serves both.
#
# Inputs (env, all optional):
#   INPUT_HARNESS / INPUT_MODEL   workflow_dispatch overrides ("(config default)"
#                                 is treated as unset — that's the dropdown's
#                                 placeholder value, not a harness name)
#   HARNESS_MODEL                 vars.HARNESS_MODEL, a repo-wide model override
#   CODEX_AUTH / KIMI_AUTH / HERMES_AUTH / GROK_CREDENTIALS
#   OPENAI_API_KEY / MOONSHOT_API_KEY / MISTRAL_API_KEY / XAI_API_KEY
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN / CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
#                                 presence ONLY — never read for their value here,
#                                 never echoed. They pick AUTH_MODE.
#
# Outputs (stdout, one KEY=VALUE per line — append to $GITHUB_OUTPUT/$GITHUB_ENV,
# or `eval` after review):

#                  a key from aeon.yml's gateway: block, see below) | none
#                  (cursor with no CURSOR_API_KEY: it has no fallback)
#   HARNESS_MODEL  the model label for logs/records ("(native:…)" on native auth)
#   MODEL_ARG      what to pass as `run-harness --model`, or empty for "the
#                  harness's own staged config decides" (always empty on claude:
#                  aeon.yml passes claude its own model id)

# The harness model (HM), in priority order:

#      the dashboard's model picker actually control what runs: modelsForHarness()
#      offers OpenRouter ids for these harnesses.
#   3. a per-harness cheap default.
# aeon-native ids (claude-*/grok-*) mean nothing to an OpenRouter CLI, so they're
# treated as "unset" and fall through to the default — a repo that never touched
# the model picker (still `model: claude-sonnet-5-5`) still gets a working default
# instead of a dead id.
# Each harness defaults to its own native family (the dashboard's per-harness
# list, modelsForHarness[0]). The generic `*)` fallback is gpt-5-mini — a
# universally safe id — NOT gpt-5-nano: codex fails DETERMINISTICALLY on nano
# (measured on a real runner the model emits a shell tool call with a duplicated
# `cmd` field, codex's strict parser rejects it, and codex, which has no
# --max-turns, spins to the 900s guard); the same skill passes on gpt-5-mini.
